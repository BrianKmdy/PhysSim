Make astronimcal scale functional
Add ability to have all orbiting entities not attracted to each other, just to high mass entity in center (star or galactic center)
Add third dimension
Add ability to render in slower than real time and output to video that plays at real time (or faster/slower than real time)
Add models for planets, household objects, atoms
Add rendered scenery (Background nebula, simple backdrops, solar system, etc)
Add interface to view numerical stats
Make scenarios programmable in python (using boost)
Ability to add fields/Charge distributions (And a way to visualize them in the rendered image if the user wants)
